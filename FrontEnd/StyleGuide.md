 ### Lighten & Darken Colour
    The darken() function decreases lightness by a fixed amount, which is often not the desired effect. To make a color a certain percentage darker than it was before, use color.scale() instead.

    Because darken() is usually not the best way to make a color darker, itâ€™s not included directly in the new module system. However, if you have to preserve the existing behavior, darken($color, $amount) can be written color.adjust($color, $lightness: -$amount).

    // #036 has lightness 20%, so when darken() subtracts 30% it just returns black.
    @debug darken(#036, 30%); // black

    // scale() instead makes it 30% darker than it was originally.
    @debug color.scale(#036, $lightness: -30%); // #002447

My Example Code:

    $rouge:#ed1a39;
    $rouge-light: scale-color($rouge, $lightness: +30%);
    $rouge-dark: scale-color($rouge, $lightness: -30%);
