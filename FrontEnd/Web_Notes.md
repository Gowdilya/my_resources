## HTTP request methods

 ####  What's the difference between POST and GET HTTP request methods?

The GET and POST are two different types of HTTP requests. GET is used for viewing something, without changing it, while POST is used for changing something. For example, a search page should use GET to get data while a form that changes your password should use POST

#### PUT VS PATCH
PUT  is a full replacement and therefore `IDEMPOTENT` :
Can be applied repeatedly  with no extra effect
